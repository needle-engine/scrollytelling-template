## Get started

Run the template locally and run `npm i` and then `npm start`.   

Then modify the content or connect it with your 3D editor like Unity or Blender to create new 3D content: It's super easy!

Visit [docs.needle.tools](https://docs.needle.tools) to learn how.

## Content

- `index.html` - Contains a content and page setup. Add or edit content to your liking
- `src/style.css` - The CSS styles for the website
- `src/main.ts` - Here we add some basic javascript to make scrolling smoother or to fade-in and -out the scroll sections when they enter the screen.
